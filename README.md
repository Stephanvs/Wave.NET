# Wave.NET

Client and Services for the .NET Framework based on the original [Google Wave Protocol] which is now in incubation at the [Apache Software Foundation].

## Protocol specifications

The original protocol specifications consists of three pilars:

* [Google Wave Federation Protocol]
    * This specification defines the server-to-server protocol that uses XMPP to enable interoperable wave providers.
* [Google Wave Conversation Model]
    * This specification defines the structure of conversations within a wave.
* [Google Wave Identifiers]
    * This defines the structure of wave identifiers.

## Design documents

The design docs page is an index of implemented designs and  proposals for significant changes and improvements to the Google Wave protocols and models.
